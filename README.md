    We are developing a system that helps to make use of the Neglected books to deliver them to the interested readers. The system will view a plenty of different books along with their owners' details. On the other hand, the readers will have a chances to either donate or borrow a book from the system.

    In the 21st century, the interset of student has changed gradually in the eductinal system.
    However, the main change the impcat the learners generally is turning away from reading the books and relying on other learning materials. 
    Which eventually leads to new careless generation of the books. 
    As a result, students are no longer giving a good care for the books they receive or buy. 
    On the other hand, there are still some learners depending on books for thier studies. 
    Therefore, this system emerged to come up with the solution for the gap. 

 # 1.2.2	Problem Statement
     It is well known that some book owners carelessly throw their books after they gain what they need from them.
     While some other readers are seeking to gain such a book.
     Above all that, knowledage should be resepcted and put in proper place until its fans comes

     IIUM community
     
# 1.4.3	Specific Platform
     For the project to be working, we might need to use the software such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code to write the application code. We might also need to use Android Studio software or Expo application as an emulator to see whether the code can be compiled and run to become an application or not.
     
# 1.5	CONSTRAINTS 
     As for the constraints, we might be having difficulties in discussing physically since our team member didn't stay in the same mahallah. Due to that, we might having difficulties to integrate the project from everyone. Since our project might not be using any financial budget, we hope that we could finish the project with using the existing software and platform that we have learned from the class.
